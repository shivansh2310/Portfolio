    <h3>Some principles of my life thet i belive in:-</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>As human beings it is our moral responsibility to reshape, protect, and build the universe for the greater good of human existence:</li>
		<ul>
            <li>We must enable and leverage technology, which is the most prominent form of human knowledge to provide a better place for everyone.</li>
            <li>With that we must also be considerate enough to understand that technology cannot solve every problem of the world.</li>
            <li>if you have knowledge spread it, if you know the technology and technique teach it. we must have an abundance mindset, we can only imporve our world if we don't think in terms of zero-sum.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Intellectual curiousity:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Life without Intellectual curiousity is a wasteful life.</li>
			<li>Have a polymath mindset, be as much curious as you can ask as much questions as you can, it is the only way to become something</li>
			<li>Learn from the master, but more important learn from youself, ask yourself questions, analyse your experience, practice your craft and then see this magic.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Live a meaningful life:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Accept what you cannot control : <q>You have power over your mind not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.</li>
			<li>Develop Resilience and patience</li>
			<li>Live a life with integrity and descipline.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
